#  Communication

This project, made for learning purposes to sending data between one main viewController and two its child viewControllers. The main goal of this communication is `separation of concerns`. To avoid of _massive view controller_ sometimes it needs to split ui into different sections, and for each of these sections create its own viewController. 
  Application in this project consist only with one screen. You can see on main screen two areas one - upper, is for parent data (name, age, etc.), another - lower, is for info of children of that parent. Each of these areas and the button for adding new child lays down on the main view (Maybe the "addChild" button is need to be laying out on upper view and managing from upper viewController).
